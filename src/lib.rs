//! day-piece-media: an external Day Piece (DESIGN.md §15) wrapping each toolkit's native media
//! player: AVPlayerView on AppKit, AVPlayerViewController on UIKit, QMediaPlayer + QVideoWidget on
//! Qt, `android.widget.VideoView` (or a bare `MediaPlayer` for sound) on Android, GtkVideo on GTK,
//! MediaPlayerElement on XAML, `<video>`/`<audio>` on the web, and an ArkTS `Video` / `AVPlayer` on
//! HarmonyOS. One Rust API registered link-time into each backend's renderer slice without touching
//! day. Like the webview it carries both a front-end and its native backends, including an
//! Android manifest permission contribution (INTERNET) and an iOS framework contribution (AVKit +
//! AVFoundation), see docs/extending.md.
//!
//! The player is a growing leaf that fills its space (constrain it with `.frame(w, h)`), unless it
//! is `.audio_only()`: a sound-only player draws nothing and measures zero, so a radio app can drop
//! it anywhere in its tree and build its own now-playing UI around it. The `url` source accepts a
//! plain string, a `Signal<String>`, or a closure, and may name a local file path or an
//! http(s)/file URL; every backend's loader takes both. Configure playback at build with
//! `.autoplay(bool)` / `.looping(bool)` / `.muted(bool)` / `.controls(bool)`; transport is
//! imperative and modeled with `Copy` `Trigger`s: `.play()` / `.pause()` / `.stop()` drive playback
//! and `.load()` re-reads the bound url (then plays), each `watch`ed to a `MediaPatch`.
//! `.volume(…)` is a tracked fraction (a constant, a `Signal<f64>`, or a closure) patched through
//! as it changes.
//!
//! Playback state comes back through `.state(signal)`: every arm reports what its native player is
//! doing (loading, playing, paused, ended, failed) on the piece's `Event::Custom` channel, and the
//! front-end writes it into the bound `Signal<PlaybackState>`. That is the readback docs/media.md
//! reserved the channel for: native chrome, the network, and the app's own triggers all move the
//! player, and the signal is where they agree.
//!
//! Native chrome (`.controls(true)`, the default) is free where the toolkit has it: AVPlayerView's
//! inline controls, AVPlayerViewController's playback controls, Android's MediaController. Qt's
//! QVideoWidget has no built-in chrome (drive it with triggers), and GtkVideo's overlay controls
//! are always on. See docs/media.md for the per-backend caveats.
